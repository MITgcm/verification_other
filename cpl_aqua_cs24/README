MITgcm coupled Ocean - Atmosphere (with pkg/aim_v23 simplified atmospheric physics)
 from David Ferreira with interactive CO2 feedback.

Low resolution (cs24) "Double Drake" configuration similar to:
 http://wwwcvs.mitgcm.org/viewvc/MITgcm/MITgcm_contrib/dfer/cpl_aim+ocn_fast/
With ocean biochemistry (pkg/dic) and coupled atmospheric pCO2 concentration
(assuming well mixed atmosphere) including CO2 radiation effect.

Original set-up from David Ferreira (2015).
Updated to MITgcm checkpoint66n code (Jan 2018) after most specific code
changes were added to main code (pkg/dic, pkg/aim_v23 & coupling pkgs).
