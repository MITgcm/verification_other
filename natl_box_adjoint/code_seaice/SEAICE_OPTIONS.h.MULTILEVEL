C--   Write "text-plots" of certain fields in STDOUT for debugging.
#undef SEAICE_DEBUG

C--   Allow sea-ice dynamic code.
C     This option is provided to allow use of TAMC
C     on the thermodynamics component of the code only.
C     Sea-ice dynamics can also be turned off at runtime
C     using variable SEAICEuseDYNAMICS.
#undef SEAICE_ALLOW_DYNAMICS

C--   By default, pkg/seaice defines forcing variable internally, in
C     SEAICE_FFIELDS.h, and reads them in from files.  When CPP option
C     SEAICE_EXTERNAL_FORCING is defined, the above forcing variables
C     are defined and provided by an external package.  At present this
C     option is hardwired for pkg/exf and the variables are passed using
C     include file exf_fields.h.
#define SEAICE_EXTERNAL_FORCING

C--   By default, the sea-ice package uses its own integrated bulk
C     formulae to compute fluxes (fu, fv, EmPmR, Qnet, and Qsw) over
C     open-ocean.  When this flag is set, these variables are computed
C     in a separate external package, for example, pkg/exf, and then
C     modified for sea-ice effects by pkg/seaice.
#undef SEAICE_EXTERNAL_FLUXES

C--   By default, the sea-ice package uses 2-category thermodynamics.
C     When this flag is set, an 8-category calculation of ice
C     thermodynamics is carried out in groatb.F
C     !!! Note the pickup_seaice.* generated by this option differ !!!
C     !!! from those generated with the default 2-category model.  !!!
C     !!! Therefore it is not possible to switch between the two   !!!
C     !!! in the middle of an integration.                         !!!
