checkpoint67v (2021/02/03) synchronised with main MITgcm code.
  - global_oce_llc90 experiment:
   1) clean/simplify parameter files location:
    * move un-used (in any FWD or AD exp) param files from input/ into
      input/unused/
    * param files which are not used in any FWD exp (but only used in some AD
      exp): move them from input/ to input_ad/
    * simplify "prepare_run" from 4 FWD input dir by removing it's own dir.
    * Ajoint input dir: since local "prepare_run" is no longer linking all files
      from corresponding FWD input dir, make a copy of few needed files.
   2) Bring back the use of viscFacInAd:
      before PR #384, the effect of viscFacAdj, was ignored. Bring it back by
      defining the (new) corresponding CPP option: AUTODIFF_ALLOW_VISCFACADJ
      (in AUTODIFF_OPTIONS.h), uncomment viscFacInAd setting in data.autodiff
      and update all 4 AD reference outputs (since viscFacInAd=2 is now active).
  - global_oce_llc90 Adjoint experiment: comment out "viscFacInAd=2." in
    data.autodiff since it was previously inactive until PR #384 code fix
    but would now require to define AUTODIFF_ALLOW_VISCFACADJ to be used.
